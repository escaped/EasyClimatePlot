  By Gary Robinson, grobinson@flyfi.com. No rights reserved -- 
  placed in the public domain -- which is only reasonable considering
  how much it owes to other people's code and ideas which are in the
  public domain. The idea of using a metaclass came from 
  a  comment on Gary's blog (see 
  http://www.garyrobinson.net/2004/03/python_singleto.html#comments). 
  Other improvements came from comments and email from other
  people who saw it online. (See the blog post and comments
